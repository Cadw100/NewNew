         <par>Harp seals are about 5 to 6 feet long, weigh about 260 to 300 pounds, and have a robust body with a small, flat head. They have a narrow snout and eight pairs of teeth in both the upper and lower jaws. Their front flippers have thick, strong claws, while their back flippers have smaller, narrower claws.</par>

        <par>Harp seal pups are born with long white fur that helps them absorb sunlight and stay warm while they're still developing blubber. Pups shed their white fur after about three to four weeks old. 4. Harp seals are highly migratory and can travel more than 3,100 miles (4,989 km) roundtrip to feed.</par>
